% This CDT_documentation folder contains the Matlab scripts that were 
% used to generate HTML-formatted help files.  The m files with names
% like *_documentation are not intended to be read by humans, rather, 
% you wi€™ll probably find much more pleasant reading if you go to your 
% Matlab command window and type 

  cdt

% Or if you know the name of the function you want to learn about, 
% for example, the recenter function, type 

  cdt recenter 

% Hope this helps, and feel free to email me if anything is unclear.
